Take Stock Span Problem

The span Si of the stockâ€™s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum
number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of
the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given
day.

For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as
{100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 7 days
are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
